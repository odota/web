  // to the alphabet, we apply bitmask on them. We look for the closest
  // `2 ** x - 1` number, which will be bigger than alphabet size. If we have
  // 30 symbols in the alphabet, we will take 31 (00011111).
  // We do not use faster Math.clz32, because it is not available in browsers.

  // Bitmask is not a perfect solution (in our example it will pass 31 bytes,
  // which is bigger than the alphabet). As a result, we will need more bytes,
  // than ID size, because we will refuse bytes bigger than the alphabet.

  // Every hardware random generator call is costly,
  // because we need to wait for entropy collection. This is why often it will
  // be faster to ask for few extra bytes in advance, to avoid additional calls.

  // Here we calculate how many random bytes should we call in advance.
  // It depends on ID length, mask / alphabet size and magic number 1.6
  // (which was selected according benchmarks).

  // -~i => i + 1 if n is integer number
