## 0.19.0
###### _Aug 15, 2017_

Big thanks to the 11 contributors who made this release possible.
As always, we are focusing on bug fixes but this time, we introduce an exceptional breaking change.

##### Breaking Changes

- [core] Removed module's reliance on react-tap-event-plugin (#7624) @lostpebble

The `react-tap-event-plugin` dependency was removed.
This change is paving the way toward supporting the upcoming react@16 release a.k.a Fiber.
The `react-tap-event-plugin` dependency was first introduced 3 years ago in order to remove
the click delay on mobile devices.
Mobiles devices' browsers have improved since then, it's no longer required.
It's time to remove this dependency, as we did it a year ago on the `v1-beta` branch.
You need to replace the `onTouchTap` property callbacks with `onClick`.

```diff
-<div onTouchTap={this.handleEvent} />
+<div onClick={this.handleEvent} />
```

Thanks @lostpebble for your hard work!

Big thanks to the 8 contributors who made this release possible.
This release almost exclusively contains bug fixes.

##### Breaking Changes

- [Table] Fix controlled behavior (#6638) @oliviertassinari

This PR is introducing a breaking change by removing the ambiguity between default state and controlled state. Now, as soon as the selected property is used, the row selection of the component is controlled, hence fully implementing what's documented:

> `selected`: This property can be used to programmatically select rows.

We are releasing sooner than we use to for this **special day** :christmas_tree::gift:.
17 contributors are making that last release of the year possible.

2016 has been an exceptional year for Material-UI.
- We went from 40k to 180k [downloads](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=material-ui&from=2014-12-24&to=2016-12-25) a month. :package:
- We went from 12k to 22k [stars](http://www.timqian.com/star-history/#callemall/material-ui). :star:

That wouldn't have been possible without this awesome community.
**Thank you!**

But this's just the beginning, some [exciting stuff](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/v0.x/ROADMAP.md) is coming in 2017 :sparkles:.

## 0.16.0
###### _Oct 3, 2016_

This release contains a ton of bug fixes and small improvements :boom:.

We have **shifted goals** for `v0.16.0`.
Across a number of issues over the last ~5 months we have been telling people that certain improvements are coming in `v0.16.0` ranging from performance to component API issues and more.
Those improvements are coming with the `next` branch :sparkles:.
We are switching in goal so we can release changes more **often**.

Regarding going forward, this is likely to be the last `minor` release using the **inline-style** approach.
We are migrating all the components to a **CSS-in-JS** approach on the `next` branch.

For more details, you can have a look a the [next milestone](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/milestone/14) as well as the [next project](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/projects/1)

:warning: New features based on the `master` branch (inline-style) have low priority and will most likely not be reviewed nor merged.

## 0.16.0-rc1
###### _Sep 8, 2016_

##### Breaking Changes
- [Badge] Swapped primary and accent colors (#4449)
- [CircularProgress] The API has become more flexible and straightforward. `size` attribute now means the outer diameter in pixels. Line thickness is variable and should be defined via the `thickness` attribute. Default margins are eliminated. If you'd like to upgrade your existing app without changing the actual sizes of your `CircularProgress` components, here are the formulas:
```js
newSize = 59.5 * oldSize;
thickness = 3.5 * oldSize;
margin = (oldSize < 0.71) ?
  ((50 - 59.5 * oldSize) / 2) :
  (5.25 * oldSize);
```
Examples:
```
// Before:
<CircularProgress />
<CircularProgress size={2} />

// After:
<CircularProgress size={59.5} style={{margin: 5.25}} /> // Thickness is 3.5 by default
<CircularProgress size={119} thickness={7} style={{margin: 10.5}} />
```

#### React 15 compatibility :tada: :tada:

This release also ensures compatibility with React 15. You should update to
this version if you need it.

#### Simplify import statements :tada:

This release changes how components are imported. You will need to update every
import statement, Like:

```js
import RaisedButton from 'material-ui/lib/raised-button';
import Tabs from 'material-ui/tabs/tabs';
import Tab from 'material-ui/tabs/tab';
```

to:

```js
import RaisedButton from 'material-ui/RaisedButton';
import {Tabs, Tab} from 'material-ui/Tabs';
```

The exact import statements for each component can be found in their respective
documentation page.

Have a ton of imports? almost had a heart attack? worry not, we also made a tool
to ease your pain. checkout the
[readme](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/packages/material-ui-codemod/README.md).

##### Breaking Changes
- [Core] Improve import path for published lib (#3921)
- [Core] PascalCase component names, reorganise directory structure (#3749)
- [Core] Remove default theme handling from components (#3820)

As of now you will need to provide theme on context, see:
http://www.material-ui.com/#/customization/themes

- [Core] Removed redundant default export from the main library `index.js`.

You will probably need to turn

```js
import Mui from 'material-ui';
```
into
```js
import * as Mui from 'material-ui';
```

Although we discourage you to use this library like that.

- [LeftNav] Rename to Drawer (#3799)
- [GridList] Replace `rootClass` with `containerElement` (#3783) (`rootClass` was broken before this change)

## 0.12.5
###### _Oct 21, 2015_

v0.12.4 should have really been v0.13.0 as it breaks compatibility with React 0.13.3. This version fixes that. We reverted some commits (related to React 0.14.0 support) from v0.12.4 to bring to you v0.12.5 that works as expected.

##### Component Fixes / Enhancements

## 0.12.4

## 0.12.0
###### _Sep 25, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Theming has been re-done so that material-ui components can be used without having to worry about passing a theme (all components implement a default theme) (#1662)
  - There's now a concept of `mui theme` and `raw theme`, `mui theme` is produced from `raw theme`
  - `ThemeManager` has been changed, no longer needs `new` in call
  - `ThemeManager` produces `mui theme` from `raw theme`. Raw themes may be user-defined.
  - Functions in `ThemeManager` allow to modify theme variables. Component-level styles may be overriden in the `mui theme`.
  - See new documentation [here](http://material-ui.com/#/customization/themes)
- Function names in the context-pure mixin have been changed (#1711)

##### Component Fixes / Enhancements
- DatePicker - Updated to new design specs (#1266)
- LeftNav - Fix sidebar position for browsers that don't support transform3d (#1269)
- TextField - Added props to override underlineStyle when disabled (#1493)


## 0.11.0
###### _Aug 24, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- The Table component is now composable. (#1199)
  - JSON objects to create the table and the table component will no longer generate the table for you.
    The docs site provides a complete example of how a table might look: http://material-ui.com/#/components/table.
    The example also includes a 'super header' and 'super footer' row.
  - **Upgrade Path:** Instead of passing in the raw JSON data, you'll need to generate the appropriate
    TableHeader/TableRow/TableHeaderColumn components and pass them in as children. The same should be applied
    to the rowData and the footer.
- Tabs can now be controlled. In order to make this work we had to change the parameters being passed back to
  the `onChange` event to: `onChange(value, e, tab)`. Where value is the value of the tab that it was changed
  to, e is the event, and tab is the actual tab component. (#1232, #1235)
- Added a new `static` flag to the ThemeManager that defaults to `true`. If you're mutating your theme variables
  after the app initializes, set this flag to `false`. This will allow us to perform some optimizations to
  components that require theme variables. (#1397)
- ListItem (#1438, #1105)
  - Nested list items should no longer be passed in as children. Use the `nestedItems` prop instead.
  - The `open` prop has been renamed to `initiallyOpen`.
- Removed classable mixin
  - This mixin was no longer used in the library. Removing it allowed us to get rid of the `classnames`
    dependency. If you were using this mixin in your own projects, you'll need to pull the source and manually
    include it.

##### Component Fixes / Enhancements
- Buttons - Fixed a bug that caused buttons to not gain keyboard focus in some cases (#1485, #1453, #1458)
- Card
  - Properly merge `CardAction` and `CardExpandable` styles. (#1376)
  - Added Right-To-Left support to `CardExpandable`. To use this, set `isRtl` to `true` in the theme. (#1408)
- DatePicker - Fixed an error that occurred when using valueLink (#1400)
- DropDownMenu - Added `disabled` prop (#1406)
- FlatButton - Added `labelPosition` prop. (#1286)

## 0.10.0
###### _Jul 9, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Removed `input.jsx` file. This component was deprecated long ago, but was never removed from the project.
- Buttons now default to a type of `button` instead of the browser's default of `submit`. We found that
  most of the buttons in our apps were not submit buttons and it was more intuitive to default to `button`.
  If you need a submit button, be sure to pass in a type of `submit`. (#1017)
- The `DialogWindow` component was refactored into `Dialog`. `DialogWindow` was never documented and was just
  a lower level component that was used by `Dialog`. It was, however, exposed on the main `index.js` and has
  since been removed. If you were using `DialogWindow` before, you should be able to safely use
  `Dialog` instead.

##### New Components
- SvgIcons & Icon Builder
  - We've created SvgIcon versions of all the
    [material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons). These SvgIcon
    components can be found in the `/lib/svg-icons` directory and were not added to the main `index.js`
    file. To use these icons, require them directly: `require('material-ui/lib/svg-icons/action/face')`.
    These icons were created using a script that crawls the icon repo and generates the
    appropriate `js` and `jsx` files and can be found in the `/icon-builder` directory.
- Menu, MenuItem, MenuDivider
  - This is a new implementation of menus and menu items. With it comes:
    - better composability
    - scrollable menus
    - better transitions
    - better keyboard access
    - selectable with value and valueLink
  - We're working on migrating some of our other components to use this new implementation. Until that's
    thats done, require these components directly if you'd like to use them:
    `require('material-ui/lib/menus/menu')`.
- IconMenu
  - This component replaces `DropDownIcon` and has all of the new menu features mentioned above.

## 0.8.0
###### _May 24, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Refactored all CSS into Javascript (#30, #316)
  - All Material-UI components now have their styles defined inline. This solves
    many problems with CSS as mentions in [@vjeux's presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)
    such as polluting the global namespace with classes that really should be
    component specific. In addition to the benefits mentioned in the
    presentation, inline styles allow Material-UI to become CSS preprocessor
    agnostic and make Themeing much more dynamic and simple.
    [Read our CSS in JS discussion](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/30)
  - Upgrade path:
    - *If you are overriding component CSS classes:* Redefine your overrides as
      an object following [React's inline styles format](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html),
      then pass it into the material-ui component via the `style` prop. These
      changes are applied to the root element of the component. If you are
      overriding a nested element of the component, check the component's
      documentation and see if there is a style prop available for that nested
      element. If a style prop does not exist for the component's nested element
      that you are trying to override, [submit an issue](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/new)
      requesting to have it added.
    - *If you are using any of Material-UI's Less files:* These files have been
      refactored into their [own javascript files](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/css-in-js/src/styles)
      and can be accessed like so `var FILENAME = require('material-ui').Styles.FILENAME;`.
      Material-UI has moved away from being a CSS Framework to being simply a
      set of React components.
- Paper component no longer generates nested divs (#601)

## 0.7.0
###### _Feb. 13, 2015_

##### Breaking Changes
- Removed Icon component - Replaced with FontIcon and SvgIcon (#318, #125, #148)
  - The main motivation here is to give developers more control over which font icons to include
    in their project. Instead of automatically including all material design icons in material-ui,
    developers can now create their own custom icon font file and just pass the icon className into
    the FontIcon component. [Read more about FontIcons](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/icons).
  - Upgrade path:
    - If you were using the Icon component before, you'll need switch to either using FontIcon or SvgIcon.
      For FontIcon, create a custom font file and include it in your project and just pass the Icon
      className into the FontIcon component. For SvgIcon, create a new React component that represents
      that particular icon. This will allow you to package your icons inside your js files. Examples
      can be found [here](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/src/js/svg-icons).
    - Additionally, all components that had an icon prop now take an iconClassName prop instead. These
      include FloatingActionButton, IconButton, Menu, MenuItem, and DropDownIcon.

##### General
- All jsx files are now being compiled before publishing to npm. (#179, #215)

##### Components
- Buttons
  - Fixed a bug that cause onClick to not fire in Safari (#307)
  - You can now pass down children into all buttons. This allows you to add icons to flat and raised buttons
    or to add a file input element. (#323, #189)
- Menu Item
  - Fixed toggle display bug (#298)
  - Toggle props can now be passed in (#299)
- Slider
