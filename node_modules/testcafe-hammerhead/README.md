# testcafe-hammerhead
`testcafe-hammerhead` is a powerful Web proxy used as a core for the [TestCafe](https://github.com/devexpress/testcafe) testing framework.

## Core Concepts

`testcafe-hammerhead` is a URL-rewriting proxy. This means that it rewrites all properties of the appropriate JavaScript objects that contain a URL value (`Location`, `HTMLLinkElement.href`, etc). You can see it if you open a proxied page, invoke the browser's DevTools and inspect any element.

In addition, the proxied web page does not know that it is opened under a proxy. The proxy intercepts access attempts to all URL-containing properties and provides the original values.

## First Look
1. Clone the Hammerhead repository
    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead.git
    ```
1. Go to the `testcafe-hammerhead` folder
    ```cmd
    cd testcafe-hammerhead
    ```
1. Install the dependencies
    ```cmd
    npm install
    ```
1. Run the [Hammerhead playground](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe-hammerhead/blob/master/test/playground/server.js) to see our proxy in action
    ```cmd
    node node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp http-playground
    ```

This opens a playground page where you can specify a webpage to proxy. Enter the page URL and hit **Proxy!**.
